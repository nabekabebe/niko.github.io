			<h3>Story of my life</h3>
	<p>My life from the beginning was very fun as I grew up living with my parents and all close relatives in small town,Bale. In the mist of all my traveling up and down, I managed to stay active.If someone asked me to use two words to describe the path I have lead in my life till now, I would have to say it has been one of hardship and perseverance.</p>
	<p>I was born in Adama, Ethiopia also grew up in Adama most of my life. My first love was programming. I would watch tutorials and then figure out how to do them my self. It wasn’t until high school that I finally introduced to programming. </p>
</div>
<div class="main">
	<h2>Introduce Me</h2>
	<p id="par">Long story short,I am Nabek Abebe, a first year software student at Addis Ababa University Currently living in the capital, Addis Ababa.</p>

	<p>My name is Nabek Abebe,first year software engineering student at Addis Ababa Institute of Technology.I had the interest of taking software 
	class since the age of 12 but it was late in my teen's that i actually got something to do about it. i started taking video tutorials and practice
	my coding skills.I have dedicated my life on improving my coding skill since.My work paid off and now I am a software engineering student
	in the the highest standard university in Ethiopia,Addis Ababa University. In my spare time I develop websites for individuals and companies
	such as school.
	<p>
	I moved on to study the software engineering in Addis, and began to grow my network.developing websites and branding work for friends and schools. Going to school during the day and cranking on design work at night. Not only was I learning the basics of quality programming during my classes, but I was also understanding what it meant to run a business in the outside world.
	</p>
	<p>
	I love what I do. The combination of business goals, mixed with human necessity, mixed with solid design is what gets me going every day.

	Don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to chat about programming, life, or just have a good ol' fashioned conversation.
